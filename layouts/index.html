To modify homepage content, look in partials/homepage.html.

This HUGE hack exists (partial homepage.html with a dirty if hack in _default/list.html) exists because for some reason,
hugo is refusing to render index.html here in layouts, _and_ theme/hyde-hyde/layouts/index.html consistently.

When running `hugo/hugo serve` index.html in layouts is correctly rendered, as expected. But when running `hugo/hugo`,
index.html in layouts is completely ignored, theme/hyde-hyde/layouts/index.html is also ignored, and the homepage only
renders _default/list.html.

Hence there is a hack in _default/list.html to check if we're rendering the homepage, and if so, render the
homepage.html partial instead of list_content.html.

I lost hours to this, who knows why. Maybe a version after v0.69.2 will fix this.
